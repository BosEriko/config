# Config
This is my personal config for Windows and OSX. Feel free to use it or fork it.

## Installation Scripts
The config is divided into parts for modularity:
1. Package Manager:
- Windows: [Scoop](https://github.com/BosEriko/scoop)
- MacOS: [Brew](https://github.com/BosEriko/brew)
2. Hotkeys - [PowerToys](https://github.com/BosEriko/powertoys) for Windows and [Karabiner](https://github.com/BosEriko/karabiner) for OSX.
3. Window Manager - [GlazeWM](https://github.com/BosEriko/glaze) for Windows.
4. Editor & Terminal - [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/BosEriko/vs) for Windows.
5. Virtual Machine - [WSL](https://github.com/BosEriko/wsl) for Windows.
6. Distro - [Ubuntu](https://github.com/BosEriko/ubuntu) for Windows.

_Note: Installation can be done in no order but ideally in order is better._

## Versioning Repository
You don't need to clone this repository to start but to version them all properly it's a good thing to clone it.
``` sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BosEriko/config.git
```

## Equipment
I also have my [list of equipments](https://github.com/BosEriko/equipment) if you're interested.
