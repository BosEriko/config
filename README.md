# Config
This is my personal config for Windows and OSX. Feel free to use it or fork it.

## Installation Scripts
The config is divided into parts for modularity:
1. Package Manager - [Scoop](https://github.com/BosEriko/scoop) for Windows and [Brew](https://github.com/BosEriko/brew) for OSX.
2. Hotkeys - [PowerToys](https://github.com/BosEriko/powertoys) for Windows and [Karabiner](https://github.com/BosEriko/karabiner) for OSX.
3. Window Manager - [GlazeWM](https://github.com/BosEriko/glaze) for Windows.
4. Editor & Terminal - [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/BosEriko/vs) for Windows.
5. Virtual Machine - [WSL](https://github.com/BosEriko/wsl) for Windows.
6. Distro - [Ubuntu](https://github.com/BosEriko/ubuntu) for Windows.

_Note: Installation can be done in no order but ideally in order is better._

## Clone the repository
To start you must first clone the repository. Run the command below on Ubuntu on WSL to clone the repository.
