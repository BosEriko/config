# Config
This is my personal config. Feel free to use it or fork it.

## Installation Scripts
The config is divided into parts for modularity:
1. Package Manager:
    - Windows: [Scoop](https://github.com/BosEriko/scoop)
    - macOS: [Brew](https://github.com/BosEriko/brew)
    - SteamOS: [Nix](https://github.com/BosEriko/nix)
2. Hotkeys:
    - Windows: [PowerToys](https://github.com/BosEriko/powertoys)
    - macOS: [Karabiner](https://github.com/BosEriko/karabiner)
3. Window Manager:
    - Windows: [GlazeWM](https://github.com/BosEriko/glaze)
4. Editor & Terminal:
    - Windows: [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/BosEriko/vs)
5. Virtual Machine:
    - Windows: [WSL](https://github.com/BosEriko/wsl)
6. Distro:
    - Windows: [Ubuntu](https://github.com/BosEriko/ubuntu)

_Note: Installation can be done in no order but ideally in order is better._

## Versioning Repository
You don't need to clone this repository to start but to version them all properly it's a good thing to clone it.
``` sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BosEriko/config.git
```

## Equipment
I also have my [list of equipments](https://github.com/BosEriko/equipment) if you're interested.
