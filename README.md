_Note: Installation can be done in no order but ideally in order is better._

## macOS Caveat
If done on macOS please update the system to the latest before installing anything. Updating the macOS version after installing everything can break the setup.

## Versioning Repository
You don't need to clone this repository to start but to version them all properly it's a good thing to clone it.
``` sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BosEriko/config.git
```

## Equipment
I also have my [list of equipments](https://github.com/BosEriko/equipment) if you're interested.
